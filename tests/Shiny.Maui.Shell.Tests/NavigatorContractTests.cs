/// <summary>
/// Source-level regression tests for the post-GoToAsync direct-BindingContext-read
/// refactor in <c>ShellNavigator.NavigateTo&lt;TViewModel&gt;</c> and
/// <c>NavigationBuilder.Navigate</c>.
///
/// Background
/// ----------
/// Both methods previously subscribed to a static <c>ShinyRouteFactory.PageResolved</c>
/// event to detect when the destination page had been resolved by DI. That event was
/// only raised by <c>ShinyRouteFactory.GetOrCreate</c>, which is only invoked when MAUI
/// Shell instantiates a page through a registered <c>RouteFactory</c>. Pages declared
/// in an AppShell.xaml as <c>&lt;ShellContent ContentTemplate="{DataTemplate ...}"&gt;</c>
/// (paired with <c>[ShellMap&lt;TPage&gt;(registerRoute: false)]</c>) are constructed via
/// the DataTemplate, never go through the factory, and therefore never raised
/// <c>PageResolved</c>.
///
/// The bug
/// -------
/// <c>NavigateTo&lt;TVM&gt;(relativeNavigation: false)</c> targeting a ShellContent route
/// would await a <c>TaskCompletionSource</c> that never completed, leaking the
/// subscribed handler. A later unrelated navigation through a registered route would
/// raise <c>PageResolved</c> with a different page, wake the leaked handler, and throw
/// <c>InvalidOperationException("Page BindingContext is not of type '&lt;original VM&gt;'")</c>.
/// On iOS the exception surfaced asynchronously through
/// <c>NSAsyncSynchronizationContextDispatcher</c> against a stale call site, making the
/// crash look like it originated from a later, unrelated navigation.
///
/// The fix
/// -------
/// <c>NavigateTo&lt;TViewModel&gt;</c> reads <c>Shell.Current.CurrentPage.BindingContext</c>
/// directly after <c>Shell.GoToAsync</c> returns. <c>NavigationBuilder.Navigate</c>
/// walks <c>Shell.Current.Navigation.NavigationStack</c> and applies each segment's
/// configure callback by index. The static <c>PageResolved</c> event is gone.
///
/// Runtime coverage gap
/// --------------------
/// A true end-to-end test of ShellContent-declared route navigation requires a MAUI
/// test host (<c>Shell.Current</c>, <c>IPlatformApplication</c>, handlers). The current
/// test project only references the source generator and runs pure-.NET unit tests, so
/// the lock-in here is at the source-contract level. If a MAUI device-test project is
/// added in the future, port these regressions into a runtime navigation scenario.
