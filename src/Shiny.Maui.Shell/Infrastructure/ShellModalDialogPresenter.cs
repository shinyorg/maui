/// <summary>
/// The default <see cref="IDialogPresenter"/> - pushes the dialog page onto the Window's modal stack.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Two deliberate choices here, both verified against MAUI's <c>ModalNavigationManager</c>:
///
/// <para><b>The Window's navigation, not the Shell's.</b> <c>Shell.Navigation</c> is a
/// <c>NavigationProxy</c> that reinterprets modal calls: outside an active Shell navigation its
/// <c>OnPopModal</c> turns into <c>Shell.GoToAsync("..")</c>, which is a route navigation - it would
/// run our <c>INavigationConfirmation</c> guard, raise Shell's navigating events, and pop whatever
/// Shell believes is current rather than this page. <c>Window.Navigation</c> goes straight to
/// <c>ModalNavigationManager</c>, which is the behaviour a dialog wants.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Dismissal is detected via <see cref="Element.ParentChanged"/>, not
/// <c>Window.ModalPopped</c>.</b> Every teardown path in <c>ModalNavigationManager</c> ends in
/// <c>RemoveLogicalChild(page)</c> - both the ordinary <c>PopModalAsync</c> and
/// <c>SyncPlatformModalStackAsync</c>, which reconciles a platform-initiated dismissal. Only the
/// former raises <c>ModalPopped</c>, so watching the parent catches strictly more cases.</para>
///
/// Pushing modally rather than navigating to the page's route (with
/// <c>Shell.PresentationMode="Modal"</c> declared in XAML) presents modally regardless of what the
/// page's XAML says, and hands the navigator the exact page instance so there is no
/// <see cref="ShellNavigationConfigurator"/> pinning race.
