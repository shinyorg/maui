/// <summary>
/// Base class for <see cref="IDialogPresenter"/> implementations that host a dialog in something
/// that is not a MAUI <see cref="Page"/> - a popup, an in-page overlay, a bottom sheet. It unwraps
/// the dialog page so subclasses only deal with a <see cref="View"/>, and restores the ordering
/// (binding, lifecycle, disposal) that the page would otherwise have given for free.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The navigator resolves a <see cref="Page"/> for the dialog ViewModel because that is what the
/// route map holds. A popup host cannot take a page, so the page's <see cref="ContentPage.Content"/>
/// is re-parented into the presentation and handed back afterwards.
///
/// <para>Three things follow from the page never entering the visual tree, and this class handles
/// all of them:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Binding.</b> A <see cref="BindableObject.BindingContext"/> normally flows down from the
/// page; once the content is re-parented its context would be inherited from whatever hosts the
/// popup, so it is set explicitly on the content itself.</item>
/// <item><b>Lifecycle.</b> <see cref="IPageLifecycleAware"/> is driven by
/// <c>Application.PageAppearing</c>/<c>PageDisappearing</c>, which only fire for a real page, so the
/// hooks are raised here instead.</item>
/// <item><b>Disposal.</b> The navigator disposes a dialog ViewModel when its page is removed from
/// the tree; a page that was never in it is never removed, so an <see cref="IDisposable"/> ViewModel
/// is disposed here.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// Unlike the default <see cref="ShellModalDialogPresenter"/>, the page underneath stays on screen
/// and keeps its own lifecycle - it neither disappears when the dialog opens nor reappears when it
/// closes.
/// </remarks>
